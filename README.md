# Task 1 - Caesar Cipher (Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.)

This is the first task of my Remote Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
I implemented the **Caesar Cipher** in Python for both encryption and decryption.

---

## 🔹 What is Caesar Cipher?
- One of the oldest classical encryption methods.
- Works by shifting each alphabet by a fixed number (key).
- Example: Shift = 3  
  - HELLO → KHOOR  
  - To decrypt, use the same key (3) and shift back.

## 📂 Files
- `caesar_cipher.py` → Python code
- `README.md` → Documentation
- `screenshot.png` → Program run example (optional)

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install Python 3.
2. Save file as `caesar_cipher.py`.
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the folder.
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```
5. Enter:
   - Message
   - Shift value (1–25)
   - Choose `E` for Encrypt or `D` for Decrypt

## 📝 Example
```
Message: HELLO
Shift: 3
Choice: E
Output: KHOOR
```
